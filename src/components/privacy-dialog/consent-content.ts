Pursuant to EU and UK data protection laws, the Georgia Institute of Technology (“Georgia Tech”) must provide you with information relating to how it will process your personal data as a participant in the research project administered by the College of Computing, Principal Investigator Duen Horng Chau  (the “PI”), Research Title “Wordflow: Interactive System for Text Editing with Large Language Models”, Research Protocol No. H23511 (collectively, the “Research Project”). 
The purpose of the Research Project is to understand user interaction patterns and preferences when using large language models.
<strong>Data Controller</strong> 
Personal data is any information that identifies you directly or indirectly, such as your name, email address and phone number and your Research Project participant number.  Georgia Tech will be the controller of your personal data. This means that Georgia Tech will be responsible for decisions taken regarding how and why your personal data is processed. 
Georgia Tech is an institution of higher education involved in education, research, and community development.  In order for Georgia Tech to conduct human subjects research, it must collect, use and process personal data related to the participants in the Research Project.
<strong>Types of Personal Data Collected</strong>
In order for Georgia Tech and the PI to conduct the Research Project, the following categories of personal data may be collected:
•	The prompt you run or share (e.g., “Make the following text grammatically correct.”)
•	Timestamp (e.g., Dec 1 2023 08:00:00 GMT-0500)
•	AI model hyperparameters (e.g., temperature settings)
Some of the data we might process about you is considered ‘special category data’. Special category data includes biometric data, genetic data, information about your health and sex life or orientation and any information that reveals your racial or ethnic origin, religious, political or philosophical beliefs and trade union membership information. 
For example, we might process special category data about you if you complete a form, email us or otherwise share with us any information concerning your religious or political beliefs or information relating to your ethnicity. 
<strong>Purposes and Lawful Bases for Collecting and Processing of Personal Data</strong>
Facilitating the Research Project: Georgia Tech will mainly use your information to facilitate the running of the Research Project and your participation in the Research Project. 
As part of the Research Project, Georgia Tech might review and analyze your personal data and create profiles about you and other Research Project participants.  The information you provide during the Research Project, or any profiles created about you might be compared to information provided by and profiles created about other participants. We might make observations and deduce information from the personal data you provide to us. 
Our lawful basis for collecting and otherwise processing your personal data for you to enroll and take part in the Research Project would be the performance of steps prior to entering into a contract with you and for the purposes of administering the contract we have with you, namely, the Research Project participation terms you sign up to. 
We might also process your personal data as part of running the Research Project for our legitimate interests, such as brand recognition, including the reputational benefits of publishing the results of the Research Project.
Our lawful bases for the processing of your special category data in the course of running the Research project will be your consent and explicit consent. 
You can withdraw your consent at any time. Please note that the withdrawal of your consent will not, however, affect, the lawfulness of the processing of your data carried out up until the withdrawal of your consent. 
Safety Reporting and Inspection Compliance:  In addition, we may process your personal data to comply with our legal obligations related to safety reporting or an inspection by a competent authority, including such authorities listed in the table under the section entitled Sources of Data and Data Transfers to Third Parties.
<strong>Other purposes:</strong>
We might process your personal data in accordance with our legitimate interests in bringing and defending ourselves against legal claims. If your special category data is processed as part of establishing, exercising or defending legal claims, such establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims will also be the lawful basis for the processing. 
Georgia Tech may also disclose certain personal information connected to your participation in the Research Project under FERPA. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) provides that “Directory Information” is information not generally considered harmful or an invasion of privacy if disclosed. Directory Information is considered public information, but the categories of information that comprise Directory Information also comprise “personal data” under the GDPR (inter alia name, address, telephone number, date and place of birth). The lawful basis for this disclosure is our legitimate interest in increasing awareness on the activities carried out by Georgia Tech for brand recognition purposes.  Please review Georgia Tech's Annual Notice of Directory Information Contents for further information, including how to object to the release of Directory Information.
Refusal to Provide Personal Data 
If you refuse to provide personal data that is required by Georgia Tech in connection with one of Georgia Tech’s lawful bases to collect such personal data, such refusal might not allow you to take part or continued taking part in the Research Project. 
Sources of Data and Data Transfers to Third Parties
We will primarily receive personal data about you directly from you. For example, when you complete a form in which you provide details about you and as part of you taking part in the Research Project. 
We may also collect and share personal data with service providers who help us recruit participants and facilitate the Research Project such as Prolifics and Amazon and operating applications which help us run the Research Project such as Zoom, Microsoft (Microsoft Teams), Meta (WhatsApp) and Box. 
Additionally, the personal data collected for the Research Project might be shared with the (a) U.S.  Federal Food and Drug Administration; (b) U.S. Office of Human Research Protection and (c) Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia (the “BOR”) so they may exercise governance and oversight over Georgia Tech’s activities in compliance with U.S. federal and state law.
<strong>International Transfers of Personal Data</strong>
Some of the above service providers and institutions may be located in countries, such as the United States, that do not recognize a level of privacy protection equivalent to that in the EEA. Please do not take part in the Research Project if this is unacceptable to you.
<strong>Individual Data Subject Rights</strong>

Portability: You may have the right to receive some of your personal data in machine readable format.  This right allows you to request that such data be sent to a third-party controller.
